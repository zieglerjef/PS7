# PS7

Within `PS7.R` there is test execution and benchmarking (for both the `sg.int` and `monteCarlo.int` functions when these functions are in the same working directory as the problem set `R.`file).  

### Files

`sg.int.R`: Function allows for multiple dimensions and parallel processing (cross-platform).

`monteCarlo.int.R`: Function that performs Monte Carlo integration (numerical integration using random numbers). Also allows for parallel processing (uses parallel package, not cross-platform).

`testThat.R`: Performs tests on `sg.int.R` function.

`testThat.mc.R`: Performs tests on `monteCarlo.int.R` function.
